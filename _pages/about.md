I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at UCLA. I work with Professor Richard Wesel and Dr. Dariush Divsalar.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

I received both B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA in 2023.
